# Styled Components Intro
This repo is an introduction to styled components that goes along with the [article](https://hungryturtlecode.com/tutorials/what-are-styled-components/) and [video](https://youtu.be/JFE_UuHtHT4) done on Hungry Turtle Code.

The code shows the conversion of a small app from using stylesheets to using Styled Components. [The initial commit](https://github.com/adiman9/styled-components-intro/tree/6063e956533135016a7bf944654864e389abbb63) is all the code with the style sheets and the most up to date code is the converted code that uses styled components.
